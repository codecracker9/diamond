      Play the music on the top right side. From day one of college, you’ve been the guy who somehow manages to squeeze in more naps than anyone else. Honestly, you might be part bear with how much you love your sleep! 🐻💤<br><br>

      It’s been three years now — three whole years of crazy memories, endless laughs, and you always being there, whether it’s for a chat, a laugh, a talk of cricket, or just chilling hanging out”<br><br>

      Your dance moves are awesome, but your real talent is making sure you never miss a chance to catch some Z’s. Thanks for sticking around through it all. Here’s to many more years of friendship — naps, jokes, and all!<br><br>

      Stay awesome (and well-rested), <strong>Love you buddy. ❤️ </strong>

      You’re my <strong>forever favorite human</strong> ❤️💯<br>
      Keep dancing through life.<br> – Lucky
